		<h2>What's this site?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>This website is (would be) a new, automatic way to process and store the requests & reservations users want to make. It's that simple.</p>

		<div>
			<p>The management of comments under journals is currently done manually. Because of this, there has to be a person who checks those comments, evaluates them, then updates the journal accordingly. This takes time, usually, a long time. The group's staff consists of busy people, and we can't expect them to consantly monitor new incoming comments. But!</p>
			<p>Through this website, new entries could be submitted and added to a list, just like the journals, automatically, without having to have someone doing this monotonous task.</p>

		<h2>Heh, I'm pretty sure the group won't care about your "great" idea...</h2>
		<div>
			<p>You're probably right, but I'm not only doing this to help the group. In the process of getting this site to where it's currently at, I've learned how to use deviantArt's API, a challange of which I've always thought that it was too much for me to handle, yet I managed to do it anyway. The creation of this site serves as a great way for me to explore the undiscovered areas in the field of Web Devlopment.</p>
