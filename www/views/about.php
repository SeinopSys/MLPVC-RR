	<h1>MLP Vector Club Requests & Reservations</h1>
	<p>An automated system for handling requests & reservations, made for MLP-VectorClub</p>
	<section>
		<h2>What's this site?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>This website is (would be) a new, automatic way to process and store the requests & reservations users want to make. It's that simple.</p>

		<h2>Okay, but... what's the point?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>The management of comments under journals is currently done manually. Because of this, there has to be a person who checks those comments, evaluates them, then updates the journal accordingly. This takes time, usually, a long time. The group's staff consists of busy people, and we can't expect them to consantly monitor new incoming comments. But!</p>
			<p>Through this website, new entries could be submitted and added to a list, just like the journals, automatically, without having to have someone doing this monotonous task.</p>

		<h2>Why does the version number look so... <em>random</em>?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>This website's complete codebase is <a href="<?=GITHUB_URL?>">available for anyone to see on GitHub</a>. The version number is the first few characters of the latest commit's ID. In this case, a commit is basically an update to the site. Whenever a new update is applied, the version number changes automatically.</p>
